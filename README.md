A dialpadded web browser should be able to use scroll lock to use numpad for changing brick layout of browser math to increase speed and ability to code within the browser. 

This browser aims to change the www. to irb. by introducing the SMUDGE protocol to a new browser on top of www. that,
includes a bitcoin to pay your SMUDGE cleaning of the www. by using AI and the irb. protocol.
