[Algorithm]

Start with a graph G that is a collection of points P.
Bag any groups of points that are element of P by adding a point b of points B to the graph that is connected to all selected elements of P.
add any random edge from every point in P to any point in B.
The DFVS algorithm should hence result in an empty graph.

Infinite Dust Bunny Graph Deletion!

[Probability] 

Does a complete graph completely go away to a dfvs? No.
Complete graph k=4 on dfvs returns a 2 vertex graph.
sufficiency quotient of bagging gives us linking incompleteness probability?
the random heuristic would give us statistics for near shot approximation of bagging?
so the quotient is what?

with a random heuristic bagging could give 1 yield in information to 0 yield in information.
perfect bagging yields idompotent results from the random heuristic. 
The quotient is yield loss in bagging from random heuristic variability.

[Assumption]

The set X or cover of the DFVS on G the linking incomplete graph returns the,
original graph G used to construct the linking incomplete graph if it is perfect.

Corollary 1: DFVS on a perfect linking incomplete graph is the reverse of the, 
linking incomplete graph building algorithm.

Asumming the corollary above the graph there is a reclarification here,
"Start with a graph G that is a collection of points P.".

For graph G to be made linking incomplete it does not have to be a,
collection of points. It can be a complete graph because corollary 1
suggest corollary 2.

Corollary 2: The more complete G/X of a set X of nodes made a cover by the DFVS,
does not affect the result of the DFVS.

This is not entirely true, corollary 2 is probably corollary 3 estimately. 

Corollary 3: Adding more graph where dfvs cover does not change after,
construction algorithm to result of dfvs in original graph of dfvs,
does not change dfvs subset.
