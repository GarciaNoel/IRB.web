# HTML-Marketplace

## About

A Frontend Desktop App for LLM manager with HTML Extensions.

This is an AI desktop app it wraps javascript for Node.js apps.

The AI marketplace is desktop HTML. I have the inspiration to 
develop Electron applications in HTML files that the application 
loads dynamically. 

## Development

run this command,
```bash
npm run start
```

and you download 'deepseek-r1:1.5b'
